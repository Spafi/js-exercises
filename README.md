# JavaScript Exercise Repository

Welcome to the JavaScript exercise repository! This repository contains several JavaScript files with exercises for you to practice and improve your programming skills. Each exercise is accompanied by a description and the necessary code to complete it. In this README, you will find instructions on how to run the tests and a legend for different symbols.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine.
3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Tests

The tests for the exercises are written using the Jest testing framework. To run the tests and check your solutions, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to execute the tests:

    ```
    npm run test-exercises-{number}
    ```

    This command will run all the tests defined in the `exercises-{number}.test.js` file and display the results in the terminal.

    Eg: For exercises-1.js, you need to run `npm run test-exercises-1`

## Additional Information

-   Each exercise file contains comments denoted by symbols like ðŸ”Ž and ðŸ”›. These symbols provide additional information and hints for solving the exercises. Make sure to read and understand them before starting each exercise.
-   The `package.json` file contains the project's metadata and specifies the dependencies required to run the tests. You don't need to modify this file.
-   The `exercises-{number}.test.js` file contains the test cases for the `exercises-{number}.js`. Running `npm run test-exercises-{number}` executes these tests and checks the correctness of your solutions.

Feel free to explore and solve the exercises at your own pace. Happy coding!

## Legend

-   ðŸ”Ž ( function name ) = Search the web for the built-in function for this task
-   ðŸ”› ( 1 / 2 ) = Two completely different ways to solve the exercise (either is good)
